        <p>When I asked <strong>Aaron Vansintjan</strong> (co-author of The <em>Future</em> is Degrowth) last year about rationing (carbon, materials etc.) he told me nobody in the degrowth <strong>community</strong> talked about rationing, but I was not in a position to check at that time. In this panel, they talk a lot about rationing , and I happen to see Jon Erickson coming to my side, which is that we should have non-tradable carbon credits in equal amounts for all humans on Earth. Others think that we should put rationing on a market (ugh! no!)<br>What is your opinion about rationing?<br></p>
